        ##=======================
        ## Purpose: To put a data frame into the Anderson-Gill form with Start Stop variables, 
        ##  along with two created time-dependent variables of the form E x g1 and E x g2, 
        ##  where E is an exposure variable, and g1 and g2 are "heavyside" functions, the sum
        ##  of which always = 1  at any time.  This works only for one exposure variable.
        ##======================
        ## Caution: Must put the exposure variable, status variable, and the time variable into columns 2, 3, 
        ## and 4, respectively.
        ## Arguments: DATA is a data frame, which includes ET: exposure variable and 
        ##  t0 is the specified time t0 for the heavyside functions g1 and g2.
        ##===================================================
        ## Value: A new data frame in the Andersen-Gill counting process form.  The two new 
        ## time-dependent exposure variables are called ET1 and ET2. 
        ## Name this data frame as DATACOUNTPROC.
